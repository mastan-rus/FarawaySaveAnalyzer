# FarawaySaveAnalyzer
Save Analyzer for Faraway: Director's Cut game

## Purpose
The purpose is to help players to check what they miss for certain achievements.

## Howto
Download latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/mastan-rus/FarawaySaveAnalyzer/releases) page.
You can also compile it yourself using [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or [MonoDevelop](https://www.monodevelop.com/).

Just run it and it will show console window with information from the save file. You may also specify save file name as a command line argument.

## System Requirements
This tool should work on Windows with Net Framework 4.6.1+ installed and on Linux with Mono.
It may also work on OS X with Mono, but I have no way to verify it.

## Other
This tool was made by analyzing differences between save files.
